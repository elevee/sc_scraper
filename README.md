CloudHound - A SoundCloud Scraper

Parses through URLs for SoundCloud embeds and puts them on a separate page for quicker consumption.

At the moment it exports to a local HTML file. 

Looking to add more features including:
  - Marking songs as listened
  - Integration with an RSS reader API
  - Consolidating songs from the same blog source
